## Contributing Translations

You can help translate all text in this app, and it is dead simple.

First you need to create a file. After, copy the content from other translation file.
```
src
‚îî‚îÄ  resources
  ‚îî‚îÄ il8n
      en.json
      pt-br.json
      // Add here. As an exemple for Spanish (Spain) translation would be added as es-es.json
```

Then, at I18l.js file just follow the steps:

```
str
‚îî‚îÄ helpers
    I18l.js
```

Import the file

```js
import ptBrJson from '../data/il8n/pt-br.json';
import enJson from '../data/il8n/en.json';
import esEsJson from '../data/il8n/en.json'; // Add previusly created es-es.json
```

Add the key name

```js
static en() {
  return 'en';
}
static ptBr() {
  return 'pt_br';
}
static esEs() {
  return 'es_es'; // This will be the array key and the selectable value at configuration
}
```

Relate the translation data to it's respective key

```js
static get(lang) {
  const data = { [
    I18n.ptBr()]: ptBrJson, 
    [I18n.en()]: enJson,
    [I18n.esEs()]: esEsJson  //[key]: translation file content
  };
  return data[lang];
}
```

Add to available languages

```js
static available() {
  return [
    I18n.en(), 
    I18n.ptBr(),
    I18n.esEs() // Key to be selected
  ];
}
```
